# Welcome to the Readme of the bias detector

This Bias Detector GUI is one of the products of my undergraduate final project, a brief report on the contents of my final project and a general demonstration of the software can be viewed at YouTube link: https://youtu.be/seAIVQtnWdI.

There are two folders here, the "code" file contains the code for this bias detector. The "results" folder contains the results generated by the software (the CSV version and the Latex version are automatically generated by the software). To run the code:

You should have an environment built by the anaconda. For example the "detector" environment. The main file to run the bias detector is the main.py. You should put main.py, bias_detector.py and window2.py together in order to run the GUI.
